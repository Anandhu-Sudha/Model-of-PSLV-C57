This was for a school exhibition, the body of the model is made with PVC pipes and Polystyrene. It has some light show and sound effect ( countdown announcement and propulsion sound effect).

This was also implemented with Arduino (Nano). A microcontroller is not required for creating a simple led chaser circuit, but considering the time and effort needed to build a chaser circuit from ground, spending money for the Arduino was the wise choice.

one more nano was inside the enclosure ðŸ˜‰


Also there was a mp3 module attached to play the countdown and sound effect. Here I've used a 'DF Player mini mp3 Module' which was cheap and easy to interface with the Nano. An amplifier module and speaker was also used.

The build was pretty straight forward apart form the one issue that I've Noticed.

It was the day i realised Arduinos can't be used for multitasking. I wanted to blink all red LEDs on the top at once and to sequentially rotate the LEDs at the bottom, at this point I realised this two separate codes can be programmed at once. Other option is adjust the timing and insert codes according to the delay.. but that also failed. Finally I had to use another Arduino nano to do these two separate patterns.

Some ws2812b LEDs strips were lying around, so added that too.

Some pictures and videos are added .
